0.5.3 (2015-03-31)
------------------
* use OpenCV and not opencv_candidate for LSH
* Contributors: Vincent Rabaud

0.5.2 (2015-03-30)
------------------
* add opencv_candidate as a dependency
  It is included but just transitively so it's better to have it
  directly
* Revert "remove dependency on opencv_candidate"
  This reverts commit 3a515e48c815b9e0c7f6df20b730b98d0dccd5df.
  The RGBD module from opencv_candidate is indeed needed

0.5.0 (2014-04-13)
------------------
* compile under Indigo

  This is just a workaround, the real problem is that the default values expect:
